# Tip Calculator

## Overview

The Tip Calculator is a simple Python script that helps you calculate the amount each person should pay when splitting a bill, including a specified tip percentage. 

## How It Works

- The user inputs the total bill amount.
- The user selects a tip percentage (10%, 12%, or 15%).
- The user inputs the number of people to split the bill.
- The script calculates the total bill including the tip and then divides it by the number of people.
- The script rounds the result to two decimal places and displays the amount each person should pay.
