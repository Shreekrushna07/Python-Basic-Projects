# Random Dot Pattern

This project creates a colorful grid of random dots using Python's `turtle` module. Each dot is drawn in a random color chosen from a predefined set of colors, resulting in a visually appealing pattern.

## Features

- Generates a grid of 100 dots with random colors.
- Utilizes the `turtle` module for graphics.
- Easy to customize the number of dots and the colors used.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x (Download from [python.org](https://www.python.org/))

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the script files.

2. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

3. The colors are defined in the same script, so you do not need a separate file for colors.

## Usage

1. Run the script using Python:

```sh
python main.py
```

2. The turtle graphics window will open, and the turtle will start drawing the random dot pattern.

3. The program will create a grid of 100 dots, each dot having a random color from the `colors` list.

## Customization

- **Number of Dots:** Change the `number_of_dots` variable to increase or decrease the number of dots.

```python
number_of_dots = 101  # Adjust this value as needed
```

- **Dot Colors:** Modify the `colors` list in the script to change the available colors.
