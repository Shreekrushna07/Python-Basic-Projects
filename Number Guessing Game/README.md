# Number Guessing Game

This is a simple Number Guessing Game implemented in Python. The game generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the player has to guess the number. The player can choose between two difficulty levels: easy (with 10 attempts) or hard (with 5 attempts).

## How to Play

1. Run the `number_guessing_game.py` script in a Python environment.
2. You will be asked to choose a difficulty level (easy or hard).
3. The game will generate a random number between 1 and 100.
4. You have a limited number of attempts to guess the correct number.
5. After each guess, the game will tell you if your guess is too high or too low.
6. Keep guessing until you guess the correct number or run out of attempts.
